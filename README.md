## How to Interact: 

- This sketch utilizes `ml5 next-gen handpose` and `p5js Speech Recognition`
- Simply make sure that your hands and within the frame of the canvas and you can manipulate all of the elements.

### Selecting an Element: 

- You can select an element by simply **calling out the element with your voice** since the sketch picks your voice up using Speech Recognition.
- In the event where it doesn't pick it up you can manually press the element symbol on the sketch to activate it.

### Performing Moves: 

There are 4 main elements: 

- `Fire`: With this, flames sprout on your hands and if you move your hands really fast in any direction, you can create a fire blast!

- `Air`: With this, if you wave one hand in the canvas air particles will flow around the canvas around your hand. If you have two hands in the canvas, you can create an airball!

- `Water`: With this, you can control a bunch of water particles which will gravitate towards your hands. If you move your hands really fast in any direction, you can create Ice Shards which shoot in that direction!

- `Earth`: With this, if you raise your hands at the top of the canvas, earth pillars will form. Once the rocks are falling, you can quickly move your hands left or right and the rocks will smash in that direction!
